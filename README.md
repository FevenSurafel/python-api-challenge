# Python API Challenge: WeatherPy & VacationPy

This project uses Python, APIs, and data analysis to explore the relationship between weather variables (like temperature and humidity) and latitude. In WeatherPy, we gather weather data for over 500 cities worldwide using the OpenWeatherMap API, and then create visualizations to understand how weather changes as you move closer to the equator. In VacationPy, we use that weather data to identify ideal vacation destinations and find nearby hotels using the Geoapify API.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the necessary libraries, and add your API keys in the api_keys.py file. The analysis is done using Jupyter notebooks, which guide you through the steps of retrieving data, analyzing it, and creating visualizations.
